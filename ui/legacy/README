# Legacy Hybrid Codebase

Allows using modern JS and JSX on files aimed for legacy codebase.

To create a new file or migrate a legacy one:
1. Create the directory structure just like desired on static assets inside of source (excluding static-assets)
2. Add your JS file
3. Use `yarn watch` for development (builds the file[s] with every change)
4. Commit your modern file. Remove the old if you're replacing an existing one as the build will execute the build task to put the files in place on deployment.

## Limitations

No npm/import. This simply transpiles, it doesn't bundle.
